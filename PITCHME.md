## Hello


- Monitoring and Automation SW Dev Team @Cegeka:
    * Thomas Coomans
    * Stefan Bucur
    * Guang Wei
    * \+ many more that are not here
- We create software projects that enhance our monitoring tools
- Tripled the number of monitored devices => a need for AI/ML

Note:

Hello,
We are the the Software Development Team that is part of the
larger Monitoring and Automation Team in Cegeka.
In the last few years, the number of devices that we are monitoring
has almost tripled, and this fact brought with it a whole new set of challenges.
One of the solutions for these challenges is Machine Learning.

## Supervised learning

Given a set of items with properties and labels, find the appropriate labels for unlabeled items.


| Name                           | Age | Gender | Ticket class | Cabin Number | Survived | 
|--------------------------------|-----|--------|--------------|--------------|----------| 
| Duran y More, Miss. Asuncion   | 19  | F      | 1st          | P1           | Yes      | 
| Duran y More, Miss. Florentina | 21  | F      | 1st          | P1           | Yes      | 
| Eitemiller, Mr. George Floyd   | 58  | M      | 3rd          | G12          | No       | 

What is the chance that Jack and Rose would have survived.

## Unsupervised learning

Trying to learn patterns in data, without having labels:
* clustering
* outlier detection
* data generation
